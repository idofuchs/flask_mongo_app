    <p>
    Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease with motor and non-motor manifestations. The nature of the disease is progressive and it develops slowly over years with a variety of clinical symptoms. Currently, there is no conclusive laboratory test to diagnose Parkinson's, and the diagnosis is often difficult, especially in the early stages when the motoric effects are not yet severe. Monitoring the progress of the disease over time requires consistent visits to the patient's clinic.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color:rgb(18, 59, 75);">Our approach</h3>
    <p>
    Since Parkinson's patients express themselves through characteristic vocal features, voice recordings are a useful and non-invasive diagnostic tool. The data we collected consists of features that are features analyzed from the sound waves from the recording of each of the people being tested. The software we created proves that it is possible to apply machine learning algorithms to a data set of voice recording characteristics in order to diagnose and determine with high percentages of accuracy whether the person has Parkinson's disease or not.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using the data collected on the various subjects and performing EDA at a high level, we will optimize the data as much as possible for the purpose of training different models and finding the best of them for the purposes of reaching a high level of accuracy in predicting the disease.
    </p>
